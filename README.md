## Statistical Analysis of Gaming Addiction
This repository contains a statistics project that analyzes the impact of digital gaming addiction on the mental, physical, and academic health of university students. The data was collected through a survey of students from several universities in Bangladesh.

# Project Goals
The main objectives of this project are:

To explore the relationship between the level of gaming addiction and various mental and physical health issues.

To investigate how gaming habits correlate with academic performance, specifically CGPA and class attendance.

To use statistical methods to validate hypotheses about the impact of game addiction on students.

To visualize the statistical findings using charts and graphs for a clear understanding of the data.

# Methodology
The project's methodology is a survey-based data analysis. The primary data source is a custom questionnaire designed to capture details about students' gaming behavior, physical health, mental health, and academic life. The analysis uses several statistical techniques:

Hypothesis Testing: We used T-tests and P-values to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between groups of addicted and non-addicted students.

Data Encoding: Categorical data from the survey (e.g., "Never," "Rarely") was converted into numerical formats to facilitate analysis.

Data Visualization: The findings are presented using bar charts to show the frequency distribution of various issues and a heatmap to illustrate correlations between different features.

# Project Files
GameAddition.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook containing the full statistical analysis, including data loading, preprocessing, and the generation of all visualizations and test results.

GameAddictionIMP.xlsx - Form Responses 1.csv: The raw dataset collected from the survey, which contains all the responses from the participating students.

Report on Impacts of Game Addiction.pdf: The final report detailing the problem statement, methodology, analysis, and conclusions of the project.

Contribution of each member on the project.pdf: A document outlining the roles and contributions of each group member.

# Key Findings
Our analysis of the survey data revealed several interesting insights into the effects of game addiction:

Mental Health: A significant percentage of addicted students reported experiencing mental disorders, with a strong correlation found between gaming and feelings of stress and aggression.

Physical Health: The data shows a notable link between gaming addiction and physical problems like neck and back pain and eye issues.

Academic Life: We observed a clear relationship between the level of gaming addiction and negative impacts on academic life, including co-curricular engagement and class attendance.

# Getting Started
To view the analysis, you can open the GameAddition.ipynb file in a Jupyter Notebook environment. You will need to have the following Python libraries installed:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter

# How to Run the Project
To run and interact with this project, you'll need to use a Jupyter Notebook environment.

Install Jupyter: If you haven't already, install Jupyter and the necessary libraries using the command above.

Start Jupyter Notebook: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command:

jupyter notebook

This command will open a browser window displaying the contents of your project folder.

Open the Notebook: Click on GameAddition.ipynb in the browser. This will open the Jupyter Notebook.

Run the Cells: You can execute each section of the analysis by running the notebook cells in order. You can either click the "Run" button at the top of the page for each cell or use the shortcut Shift + Enter. The code will perform the data loading, statistical calculations, and display the visualizations directly within the notebook.
